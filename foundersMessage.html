            <h1>Founder's Message</h1>

            <p>
            Sustainable design and construction - true philosophical sustainability - is a process where everyone on the team is respected for their skills and knowledge. It utilizes an integrated delivery process, removing the lowest common denominator, and replacing it with a team mentality of good is not good enough unless it is the best. What I observed in over 20 years of working in the industry and then validated through the process of developing the Alberici Headquarters building, was that no one in the traditional delivery team was willing to use sustainability as a way to raise the bar. No one in the traditional delivery model wanted to create value for the owner and building occupants. I realized there was a need for someone to enter the project delivery model who can keep the team focused on sustainability as it applies to the entire process.

            Vertegy was formed because of the passion I feel toward sustainable design and construction. The completion of the Alberici Headquarters building led me to find a renewed energy and interest in an industry in which I have grown up. Three generations of my family before me worked as contractors. My family took great pride in what they did for a living and in the contributions they made through their actions in the community and the industry. As a fourth generation constructor, now consultant, I understand the importance of changing the way project teams deliver projects. If we do not adapt and evolve our processes, there will be nothing left for future generations.

            Vertegy has the capability to integrate with the team and assist them in creating greater owner value and occupant satisfaction through the application of sustainable strategies. Regardless if the motivation of the team is to create a high performance building, create a low impact development, demonstrate an environmentally sensitive commitment or have a project certified by a third party such as LEED or Green Globes, Vertegy can help.
